# **Book Borrowing Website**
## Description
This **Book  Website** is a full-stack web application designed to facilitate the process of borrowing books online. Built with **Spring Boot** for the backend and **React** for the frontend, the system allows users to explore available books, filter by genres, make reservations, and manage borrowed books easily.
- **Motivation:** The motivation for creating this project stemmed from the need for a seamless and efficient online book borrowing platform.
- **Why was this built?** The project was developed to provide a solution to challenges faced by libraries and users in managing book loans. By integrating modern technologies, we aimed to create a user-friendly system that simplifies both customer and library staff experiences.
- **Problem it solves:** It addresses issues like complex book search processes, unorganized book reservation handling, and ineffective communication between users and library management.
- **What did I learn?** Through this project, I learned how to effectively integrate frontend (React) with backend (Spring Boot), handle user authentication, and build scalable full-stack web applications.
